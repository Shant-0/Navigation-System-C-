A terminal-based Campus Navigation Assistant.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Shortest Path Navigation 

- Closest 3 Locations

- Human-readable directions (North, South-West, etc.)

- Distance-based routing

- Error-proof input handling

- Fast menu-driven interface


The graph is fully undirected with proper compass directions.

## 🔧 Technologies

+ Language: ANSI C (C99/C11)

+ Graph Storage: Adjacency List (Linked List)

+ Path Reconstruction: Parent pointers

+ Direction Chains: Multi-hop direction sequence builder

+ Input Normalization: Whitespace removal + lowercase conversion


## 📦 Compilation

```gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o campus_nav campus_nav.c```

▶ Running 
```./campus_nav```

You will see:
