A terminal-based Campus Navigation Assistant that calculates:

✔ Shortest route between two campus locations 

✔ Step-by-step turn-by-turn directions 

✔ Closest 3 nearby locations 

✔ Distance between all nodes 

✔ Clean, interactive menu interface

Powered by Dijkstra’s Algorithm and an Adjacency List Graph.

# 🚀 Features

- Shortest Path Navigation 

- Closest 3 Locations

- Human-readable directions (North, South-West, etc.)

- Distance-based routing

- Error-proof input handling

- Fast menu-driven interface

# 🗺 Campus Nodes

The system includes 17 nodes representing real locations:

+ PunchGate

+ Joint01 — Joint04

+ Ground

+ WiFi

+ LectureGallery

+ MBA

+ Class107-111

+ Class112-115

+ Pigeonhole

+ PrayerHall

+ Journal

+ Auditorium

+ StairsCafe

+ Gate

The graph is fully undirected with proper compass directions.

# 🔧 Technologies

+ Language: ANSI C (C99/C11)

+ Graph Storage: Adjacency List (Linked List)

+ Path Reconstruction: Parent pointers

+ Direction Chains: Multi-hop direction sequence builder

+ Input Normalization: Whitespace removal + lowercase conversion

# 📐 Algorithm

Uses Dijkstra to compute shortest paths.

Two versions implemented:

* dijkstra()
→ Optimized to stop early for single-destination routing.

* dijkstra_all()
→ Computes all distances for “closest locations”.

# 📦 Compilation

```gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o campus_nav campus_nav.c```

## ▶ Running 
```./campus_nav```

You will see:
